          There are fewer than 25,000 blue whales, the largest animals on the
          planet. Comprising several subspecies, blue whales are found in all of
          the world’s oceans save the Arctic. The current population is thought
          to have been reduced by up to 90% by whaling in the 20th century.
          Commercial hunting of the species was ultimately banned in 1966. The
          National Marine Fisheries Service of the U.S. spelled out a recovery
          plan in 1998. It stipulated the maintenance of photo databases of
          individual specimens and the collection of genetic and migration data
          in order to better understand the species, which remains at risk from
          ship collisions and entanglement in fishing nets.
