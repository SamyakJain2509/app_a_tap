          Everyone loves a panda…they might be the kitschiest animal humanity
          has driven to the brink of extinction yet. From stuffed animals to
          martial arts-trained CGI abominations, we just can’t seem to get
          enough of the bi-colored beasts. Though their “aww factor” may verge
          on the cloying, it hasn’t been without effect. China, which is home to
          the remaining wild population of fewer than 2,500 individuals, has
          since the late 1980s instituted more stringent habitat protections and
          poaching has all but ceased. Their status is still tenuous, though.
          Their range is fragmented and they are still subject to disease,
          occasional predation, and starvation when large swathes of the bamboo
          on which they feed completes its life cycle and dies.
