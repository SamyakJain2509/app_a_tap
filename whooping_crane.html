        <p class="animal-info">
          In 1938, the first year a population survey was conducted, only 29
          whooping cranes remained in the wild. Three years later, only 16 were
          left. Hunting and reduction of their wetland habitat had vitiated the
          population and concerted efforts to salvage remnant birds did not
          being until the late 1960s. Today, there are over 400 birds, thanks in
          large part to innovative breeding programs. Though a plan that
          involved transferring whooping crane eggs to the nests of related
          sandhill cranes for fostering ultimately failed, captive rearing and
          reintroduction have established two wild populations in Florida, one
          of which has been taught to migrate to Wisconsin. Neither is
          self-sustaining. The only self-sustaining population migrates between
          Alberta, Canada, and Texas, U.S.
